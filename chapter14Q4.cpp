/*Create a function called swaps() that interchanges the values of the two arguments sent
to it. (You will probably want to pass these arguments by reference.) Make the function
into a template, so it can be used with all numerical data types (char, int, float, and so
on). Write a main() program to exercise the function with several types.*/
